# React Playground

This is where I experiment / test with different concepts, libraries, and/or develop any React challenges that I find interesting.

### Currenct state:

`/zustand/todo-list` -> A simple todo list component built with [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction).

`/redux/todo-list` -> A simple todo list component built with [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org).
